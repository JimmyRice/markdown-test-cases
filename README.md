# Markdown Test Cases

This project will be used to test the results of different Markdown parsers in converting various Markdown standards and writing styles into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to evaluate the parser's compatibility. The project will provide the following Markdown standards and commonly used syntax, both standard and non-standard (please note: MDX is not included):

- [x] [Original Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
- [ ] [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
- [ ] [GitHub Flavored Markdown or GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- [ ] TeX (LaTeX) in Markdown
- [ ] Front Matter in Markdown
